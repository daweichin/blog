![A landscape](/test/test123.jpg)

After the success of last years trip, it only made sense to do it again.

## The route

The route went something like:

1. Osaka -> Nara
2. Nara -> Wakayama (partial train)
3. Wakayama -> Tokushima (via ferry) -> Momonga Happy Village
4. Momonga Happy Village -> Kochi
5. Kochi Rest Day
6. Kochi -> Susaki
7. Susaki -> Shimanto
8. Shimanto -> Uwajima
9. Uwajima -> Matsuyama
10. Matsuyama -> Imabari
11. Imabari -> Omishima
12. Omishima -> Onomichi --> Osaka (Shinkansen)

## The goal

To make it as a group safely and enjoy the ride :)

## Preparation

No special preparation was done before the trip - being right off the back of exams most of us didn't have much time to get fit, but luckily we had the experience from the previous year and things worked out fine.
