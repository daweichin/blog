# A cycle around japan

![A landscape](/test/test123.jpg)

## The Context

Having been to Japan for holiday twice over the last two years, the charm of the country's traditions, culture and mystery inspired yet another trip before we had even began. I will never forget the feeling of stepping out of the first train station - Tsuruhashi in Osaka and feeling like I had entered another world.

During the year, a famous youtuber (Abroad in Japan) had begun a series called "Cycle across Japan", where he was attempting to cycle from Yamagata to Kagoshima across the span of a few months. While we did not have that much time or budget (being mere students at the time), two of my close friends and I decided it would be fun to do a similar trip.
